Project idea for SF Hacks 2019 http://sfhacks.io

## Description

Frankly speaking, music follows every step. We can hear it at home, at a restaurant, cafe, literally any event we go to. We decided that it would be an awesome idea to request songs for your taxi ride (uber, lyft or any other tax cab service). You order taxicab and while the driver is arriving you can choose the songs you want to play. After you send the playlist to a driver and when he/she picks you up your playlist start playing from drivers phone.

### `What we made in 24 hours`

We focused on a front end just to illustrate the idea. After you selected your addresses (we make a fake call to a fake taxi cab service) you can see the car image on top which starts to move to the right. At some point, it will reach Your destination. You can choose songs and it will show you how much of your ride you have covered. Next screen is a play screen a small illustration of a simple web player for the client. We haven't implement any backend because of time restriction but it can be easily achieved if needed.
